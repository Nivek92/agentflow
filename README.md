# AgentFlow

AgentFlow is a lightweight, event-driven framework designed for building and managing multi-agent systems that simplifies the orchestration of dynamic agent interactions while maintaining the highest standards of software design and reliability. It's event-driven design makes it easy to extend and ensures that it can handle a wide range of scenarios, from simple single agent applications to complex multi-agent systems. 
Thanks to lightweight components it's easy to align with SOLID design principles, making it straightforward to debug, test, and maintain - ensuring the robustness of your code.
