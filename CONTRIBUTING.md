# Contributing to AgentFlow

Thank you for your interest in contributing! As an open source project, we rely on developers like you to improve the AgentFlow framework.

There are many ways to contribute, from reporting bugs and suggesting features to improving the code quality.

We are extremely thankful for any contributions.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Contributing Code

To contribute to this project, please follow a ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow.
Please do not try to push directly to this repo unless you are a maintainer.

Before taking on significant code changes, please discuss your ideas on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eksHwhEA) to ensure they align with the project vision. We want to keep the codebase simple and unintimidating for new users.

Make sure document newly added code with clear code comments explaining your approach. Try to follow existing conventions in the code.

We will review PRs when possible and work with you to integrate your contribution. Please be patient as reviews take time. 

## üö©GitHub Issues

Our [issues](https://github.com/Nivek92/agentflow/issues) page is kept up to date with bugs, improvements, and feature requests.

There is a taxonomy of labels to help with sorting and discovery of issues of interest. Please use these to help organize issues.

If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single, modular bug/improvement/feature.
If two issues are related, or blocking, please link them rather than combining them.

We will try to keep these issues as up-to-date as possible, though some may get out of date.
If you notice this happening, please let us know.

## üôãGetting Help

Our goal is to have the simplest developer setup possible. Should you experience any difficulty getting setup, reach out to use on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eksHwhEA).
Not only do we want to help get you unblocked, but we also want to make sure that the process is smooth for future contributors.
